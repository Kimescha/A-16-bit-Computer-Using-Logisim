# A-16-bit-Computer-Using-Logisim

The goal is to design a functional CPU containing ALU and other major parts.

The basic computer consists of the following hardware components:

1. A memory unit with 4096 words of 16 bits each
2. Nine registers: AR, PC, DR, AC, IR, TR, OUTR, INPR, and SC
3. Seven flip-flops: I, S, E, R, lEN, FGI, and FGO
4. Two decoders: a 3 x 8 operation decoder and a 4 x 16 timing decoder
5. A 16-bit common bus
6. Control logic gates
7. Adder and logic circuit connected to the input of AC
